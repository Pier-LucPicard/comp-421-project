Our website was created using html, javascript, css and php.
It has dependencies to jquery and material design.
The start page of the website is index.php.
Other pages can only be accessed by first authenticating in index.php.
The postgresql queries are executed in the queries.php file (other pages make http requests to that file).

The website allows to create user account, login, create walls, post on walls, react to posts, comment on posts,
react to comments, delete posts, delete comments, delete walls, search for users and visit user profiles.

We have signed up for a demo slot, so we have not included screenshots of the execution.
