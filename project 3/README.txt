Files of the form QX.sql contain the answer to question X (and a demonstration script if asked).
Files of the form QX_trace.txt contain the execution trace of question X.
The folder "Q2" contains the files for our GUI, which is a website.
We have also included the Q9_datagenerated.sql file from project 2, as the demonstration of our procedure for question 1
relies on this data (this file creates all tables and populates them).

For bonus points, we chose to create a sophisticated GUI.
